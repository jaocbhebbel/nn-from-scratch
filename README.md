# nn-from-scratch

this is the readme for my 2nd ai project. I will be making a NN from scratch in python, using concepts I learned in 3Blue1Brown's series on NNs. 

"from scratch" means I'll not be using any python AI libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow. Instead, I'll just be using numpy to help with the mathematics behind it.

When I get stuck, I will be refernecing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU I think it is a great resource for this type of learning.
